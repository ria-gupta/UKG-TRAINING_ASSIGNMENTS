Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, 
and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. It is what causes you to act, 
whether it is getting a glass of water to reduce thirst or reading a book to gain knowledge.
Motivation involves the biological, emotional, social, and cognitive 
forces that activate behavior. In everyday usage, the term "motivation" is 
frequently used to describe why a person does something. 
It is the driving force behind human actions.
